# Indie Book Vault Full Project
 
## Purpose:
- To create a full-stack website where indie authors can apply for listing on the site and have their information displayed to visitors of the site, potentially leading the visitor to follow a link to their social media and/or author websites to purchase their books
- To fill the need of providing readers a centralized place to find indie authors of various genres

## Tech Stack Used:
- React.js
- Node.js
- Express.js
- MySQL

## Achievements
- implemented a dynamic author listing feature using the Fisher-Yates shuffle algorithm, ensuring a randomized display for users on every site visit
- implemented server side and form side validation to ensure the user submits the information appropriately and without duplication in the database
- demonstrated proficiency in MySQL database management, optimizing queries and operations for efficient data storage and retrieval
